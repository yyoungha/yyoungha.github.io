## Questions

- What are algorithms?
- Why is the study of algorithms worthwhile?
- What is the role of algorithms relative to other technologies used in computers?

## Algorithms

An **_algorithm_** is a sequence of computational steps that transform the input into the output.

We can also view an algorithm as a tool for solving a well-specified **_computational problem_**.

An algorithm is said to be **_correct_** if, for every input instance, it halts with the correct output.

We say that a correct algorithm **_solves_** the given computational problem.

## Algorithms as a technology

The reason why we have to study algorithms:

1. demonstrate that your solution method terminates and does so with the correct answer.
2. algorithms that are efficient in terms of time or space will help you use resources wisely.

## Why do we need algorithms?

Total system performance depends on choosing efficient algorithms as much as on choosing fast hardware. Although some applications do not explicitly require algorithmic content at the application level (such as some simple,Web-based applications), many do.
